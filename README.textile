h1. flask-hamster

Experimental hamster flask app. Right now it's super rough and can only list your current activites.
I've started this project merely to pick up flask and advanced javascript, but the general 
direction makes sense, methinks!

There is no rush nor priority, so it's gonna be ready whenever if ever.
Here is what it looks like right now:

The good news is that it's using the same db/client code that hamster does, so there is no code duplication there!

h1. Installing

The project right now assumes that you have a populated hamster database in ya homes.

# i suggest you create a virtualenv for this project
# @pip install -r requirements.txt@
# @./flask-hamster.py@
# now it's on your localhost: http://localhost:5000/

h1. Bugs

bug reports ain't accepted at this moment, nor feature requests and me-toos and +1 :)
but if you have a pull request where you like totally add cool stuff, then i'm all for it!
